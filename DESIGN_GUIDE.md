**Design System Prompt for Skagit County Data Portal**

You are creating a web page that follows the OpenSkagit.com design system. Adhere strictly to these visual and functional guidelines:

**Color Palette:**
- Primary brand color: Sage green (#6B9080 or similar muted teal-green)
- Accent green for buttons and CTAs: Medium sage (#7FA693)
- Text: Dark gray/charcoal for headings, medium gray for body text
- Background: Off-white/light gray (#F5F5F5 or #FAFAFA)
- Cards: Pure white (#FFFFFF) with subtle shadows

**Typography:**
- Headings: Bold, sans-serif (appears to be a modern geometric sans-serif)
- Body text: Regular weight sans-serif, good readability
- Hierarchy: Large bold headings, medium subheadings, readable body text
- Use sentence case for most UI elements

**Layout & Spacing:**
- Clean, generous whitespace throughout
- Center-aligned hero sections
- Card-based layouts with consistent padding (approximately 24-32px internal padding)
- Rounded corners on all cards and buttons (approximately 8-12px border radius)
- Grid layouts with equal spacing between cards

**Component Patterns:**

*Header:*
- Small logo/icon on left with "OpenSkagit.com" text
- Tagline on right ("AI-Enhanced Data Portal for Skagit County")
- Clean, minimal header with subtle bottom border or shadow

*Hero Section:*
- Large heading with brand color highlight (e.g., "Discover **Skagit County** Data")
- Descriptive subtitle in gray
- Central search/input field with rounded corners
- Primary action button in sage green with white text and arrow icon

*Card Components:*
- White background with subtle drop shadow
- Icon at top (simple, line-style or filled icons in brand colors)
- Bold title
- Gray descriptive text
- Status indicator ("Available Now", "Coming Soon") in small pills/badges
- Checkmark for available items

*Data Visualization:*
- Circular progress indicators/gauges
- Use sage green for positive metrics, gray for neutral
- Large numbers with descriptive labels below
- Color-coded status labels (green for "Excellent", etc.)

*List Items:*
- Circular percentage badges on left (filled ring style)
- Clear information hierarchy: address, details, price
- Consistent spacing and alignment
- Subtle dividers between items

**Interactive Elements:**
- Buttons: Sage green background, white text, rounded corners, subtle hover states
- Input fields: Light background, rounded corners, clear placeholder text
- Icons: Simple, consistent line weight, aligned with text
- Toggle options: "List", "Grid", "Map" with clear active states

**Content Tone:**
- Professional but accessible
- Clear, action-oriented labels
- Focus on data accessibility and insights
- Helpful, informative descriptions

**Key Principles:**
1. Maintain generous whitespace—never cramped
2. Keep sage green as the primary interactive color
3. Use cards for all major content groupings
4. Ensure clear visual hierarchy
5. Prioritize readability and scannability
6. Include helpful status indicators and metadata
7. Use icons sparingly and consistently

When generating new pages, maintain this exact aesthetic: clean, modern, government-friendly data portal with a distinctive sage green accent color and card-based information architecture.
