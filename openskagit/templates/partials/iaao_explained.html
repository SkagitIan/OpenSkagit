      <h4>Market Grouping</h4>
      <p>
        Skagit County isn’t one housing market — it’s several.  
        Homes in Anacortes behave differently than homes in Sedro-Woolley or Concrete.
        We segment sales into <strong>market groups</strong> so each area is modeled on its own dynamics.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2 text-sm opacity-80">
        Why it matters: location-based modeling produces far more accurate and fair valuations.

    <div class="step-number">2</div>
    <div class="step-content">
      <h4>Data Filtering & Cleaning</h4>
      <p>
        We remove non-market sales, outliers, and unusual properties that distort the regression.
        This includes trimming the top/bottom percentiles for price and home size, and excluding
        luxury properties that follow different pricing patterns.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2 text-sm opacity-80">
        Why it matters: clean data → stable coefficients → low COD.

    <div class="step-content">
      <h4>Feature Engineering</h4>
      <p>
        We convert raw property data into statistically meaningful predictors. 
        This includes log-transforming living area, lot size, and age; building time trends; 
        and creating interaction terms to capture how features behave together.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2 text-sm opacity-80">
        Why it matters: lets the model capture diminishing returns and nonlinear relationships.

    <div class="step-number">4</div>
    <div class="step-content">
      <h4>Regression Modeling</h4>
      <p>
        We fit a robust OLS regression for each market group and value tier using thousands of sales.
        This identifies how much each property feature contributes to price. Predictions are 
        back-transformed using exponential smearing to avoid bias.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2 text-sm opacity-80">
        Why it matters: the model “learns” real-world pricing behavior directly from the market.

      <h4>Validation & Fairness Checks</h4>
      <p>
        We run industry-standard diagnostics including the Coefficient of Dispersion (COD), 
        Price-Related Differential (PRD), and median ratio studies.  
        Models must meet <strong>IAAO compliance ranges</strong> to be accepted.
